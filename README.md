# MIRS_Multifractal_Anaysis

## Overview
Mid-infrared spectra (MIRS) of milk samples are frequently employed for milk quality evaluations, encompassing various milk quality parameters. However, conventional milk spectral data analyses have overlooked the scaling nature, known as stochastic similarity in different scales, inherent in milk spectral data. 

The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance of accounting for scaling properties in milk spectral data analysis.

## Dataset
The data utilized in this study was collected from the Teagasc research dairy farm in Moorepark, Ireland. 

## Methods
A set of twelve descriptors is computed to characterize scaling properties in milk spectral data within the wavelet domain. These descriptors, as stored in Wavelet_Features.csv, are then assessed for their effectiveness in milk quality assessments utilizing 18 different milk quality parameters. They notably demonstrated comparable performance to existing methods while utilizing fewer features when applied to a MIRS dataset.

## Matlab Implementation
Test.m, along with the Matlab Codes directory, contains the code neccessary to generate the Wavelet_Features.csv file. Please observe that one will need to acquire the MIRS data set in order to generate the csv file.

## Python Implementation
The python code necessary to generate classification models and figures seen in the associated study can be seen in Reproduce_Results.ipynb. Please observe that the purpose of this code is only to demonstrate the how our outcomes were generated. Code that has been commented out may take some time to run.

## Outcomes
The KDE_Plots directory, PythonResults directory, and Training_Testing_Accuracy directory contain the figures generated by Reproduce_Results.ipynb.
